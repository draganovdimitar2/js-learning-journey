# Roadmap

1. Learn the syntax first — get comfortable with JavaScript basics.

2. Solve some SoftUni tasks — practice real assignments and build confidence.

3. Tackle basic algorithms — improve problem-solving skills and deepen language understanding.

3. Aim to solve LeetCode problems later — apply what I’ve learned to more challenging coding problems.
