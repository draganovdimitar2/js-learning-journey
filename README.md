# Roadmap

1. ➡️ **Learn the syntax first** — get comfortable with JavaScript basics.

2. ➡️ **Solve some SoftUni tasks** — practice real assignments and build confidence.

3. ➡️ **Tackle basic algorithms** — improve problem-solving skills and deepen language understanding.

4. ➡️ **Aim to solve LeetCode problems later** — apply what I’ve learned to more challenging coding problems.
