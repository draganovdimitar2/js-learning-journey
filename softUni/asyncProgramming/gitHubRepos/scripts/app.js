// Your task is to write a JS function that loads a github repository asynchronously with AJAX. You should use the Fetch API. Obtain the data by making  a GET request to the following URL: “https://api.github.com/users/testnakov/repos”
// Transform the body to text with res.text() and in the second then() block of the Promise replace the text content of a div element with id "res" with the value from the response. Do not format the response in any way.


function loadRepos() {
   const resDivEl = document.querySelector('#res');

   fetch('https://api.github.com/users/testnakov/repos')
      .then(res => res.text())
      .then(data => {
         resDivEl.textContent = data;
      });
}
